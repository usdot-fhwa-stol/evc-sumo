# EVC-SUMO
This repository has Econolite Virtual Controller (EVC)-SUMO bridge tool that is a part of XiL co-simulation tool. This bridge acts as a mediator between EVC (via the PyEOS Python package) and SUMO, integrating the exchange of traffic light status and detector status.

NOTE: Currently, in order to build and use the docker image, the tool needs proprietary github-token accessible to the members of the usdot-fhwa-stol organization due to Econolite's license.
